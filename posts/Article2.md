*It all begins on coffee farms situated in lush, equatorial regions. Coffee beans grow on trees, usually as cherries that ripen to vibrant red hues. The journey continues with a series of meticulous steps:*

1. **Harvesting:** Skilled farmers handpick ripe coffee cherries, ensuring only the best are chosen for processing.

2. **Processing:** The cherries are processed to remove the pulp and extract the beans. This step varies based on the method used – washed, natural, or honey.

3. **Drying:** Beans are sun-dried until they reach the ideal moisture level for storage and export.

4. **Milling and Export:** The dried beans are milled to remove the protective parchment layer and sorted. They are then exported to coffee roasters around the world.

5. **Roasting:** Roasters carefully roast the beans to unlock their unique flavors and aromas. This step requires expertise and artistry.

6. **Brewing:** The final stage takes place in your kitchen or your favorite café. The beans are ground, brewed, and served as that delightful cup of coffee you enjoy.
